When you get into FPV drones, you probably want to record video from your drone, and if you want high quality video, you probably would consider a GoPro. Personally, I use a GoPro Hero 8, and these are the settings I use to optimize for different situations.

### Linear Flying

One of my favorite shots to get is flying low and fast, getting motion blur from the ground. In this case, I think 30fps looks decent.

* 30FPS
* 4K (4:3)
* 1/60 shutter speed
* Lowest possible ISO
* ReelSteady or Gyroflow

### Cinewhoop Indoor Style Flying

In the case of cinewhoop-style flying, 30FPS does not look good; I find that it feels disorienting to look at video from a yaw because the field of view is so wide, but increasing the FPS helps to compensate (and I *do* like the wide FOV).

* 60FPS
* 2.7K (4:3)
* 1/120 shutter speed
* Lowest possible ISO
* ReelSteady or Gyroflow

### Acrobatic Freestyle

Who *isn't* curious about freestyle when they get into FPV? The thing is, I don't want my freestyle flight to look as smooth as my cinematic-styled flights. For this reason, I use hypersmooth instead of post-processing stabilization.

* 60FPS
* 2.7K (4:3)
* 1/120 shutter speed
* Lowest possible ISO
* Hypersmooth

Do you think you have better settings? Leave a comment letting me know what I can improve.
