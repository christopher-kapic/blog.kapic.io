I was recently interviewed for a React, Java, and JavaScript role. I do not yet know Java, so we skipped those questions, but here are the questions we did cover, along with their answers (in case you see them in your own interview).

#### What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?

#### What is the spread operator in JavaScript?

#### How does class inheritance work in object-oriented languages?

#### What are promises in JavaScript? What are the three promise states?

#### What are load errors? Runtime errors? Logical errors?

#### React hooks
