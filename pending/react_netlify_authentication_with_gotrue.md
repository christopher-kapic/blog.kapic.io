I recently made a [post](/react_firebase_authentication) about authentication with React and Firebase, and I have been messing around with Netlify's Identity service, so I figured I would make a post about how to handle authentication with Netlify. Now, Netlify has a simple module that you can use just to _have_ authentication, but to use it for role-based access it is a little trickier.

_This post is a work in progress._
